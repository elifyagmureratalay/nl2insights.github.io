I will provide a JSON input containing multiple news items, each under a different index. Each item includes at least the fields title, description, and content.

Your task consists of the following internal steps, but only the final formatted result should be displayed:

Internally parse each index and extract the fields: title, description, and content.

Internally classify each article based on:

Topic: [Politics, Economy, Health, Sports, Culture, Environment, Technology, Education, Law]

Subtopic: A specific issue (e.g., “Inflation”, “Elections”, “Cybersecurity”)

Region: [Global, China, United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Turkey, Other (specify)]

Sector Affected, Event Type, Sentiment, Target Audience, Time Dimension

Detect and group articles that are about the same event or topic (duplicates or near-duplicates).
Give attention to the details.

For each group, display a single combined output in the following format:

pgsql
News Title: <representative title from the group>

News Summary: <summarized version combining "description" and "content" of the grouped articles>
Only show the grouped and summarized result above.
Do not display index numbers, classification details, or individual entries.
Each unique or duplicate group must appear only once with one title and one summary.
While summarizing, numerical data, key statistics, dates, figures, or other critical information must be preserved. The summary should remain concise but ensure that such essential details are not omitted.
